Project Name: Simple Store Transaction System

Description:
This is a Java Swing application that simulates a store checkout system. It uses three separate windows (JFrames) to manage sales, track inventory, and record transaction logs. The project demonstrates how to share data between different parts of a program using only arrays, without using a database or Java Collections like ArrayList.

Files in this Project:

Main.java - The starting point of the program. It initializes the data arrays and launches the application.
StoreFrame.java - The main window where users select products and make purchases.
LogsFrame.java - A window that displays the history of all transactions.
InventoryFrame.java - A window that shows the current stock levels.
